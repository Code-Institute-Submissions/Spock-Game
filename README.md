## About

**Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game** it is a gameing site for fans of the big bang theory and star trek new or old who would like to have a go playing the game they seen thier favorite characters playing.

I desgined the site to follow the big bang theory show logo colour scheme and to maintain the same colours through out the site. The site is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices in turn making the site easy to navigate for the users who will use the site.

The goal of the Spock Game website is to provide a game which users that would like to try out playing a spock game will have a chance to play it or returing users who have played similair games. The site will also encourage feedback from the users by a contact form.

### **Site Owner Goals** 

## **Design Choices**

### **Fonts**

I chose to use [Be Vietnam Pro] (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Be+Vietnam+Pro:wght@100&display=swap) for the header as it is easy to read and it has sufficient contrast to the main body font. The rest of the site i used (font-family: sans-serif) as it went well with header font.

### **Colours**

The spock game site will follow the big bang logo colour scheme throughout the site as i wanted to maintain a consistency on the site for the users and the colours complemted each other well.

The colours that where chosen are:
